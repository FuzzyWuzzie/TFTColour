=== TFT Colour Picker ===
Just a simple colour picker for Adafruit's TFT screens.
These screens use a rarely-seen colour format called
"rgb565", which packs 16-bit colour instead of the more
usual 24-bit colour (often called "rgb888"). It does this
by storing the top 5 bits as the blue value, the middle 6
bits as the green value, and the bottom 5 bits as the blue
value.

This is normally trivial to do with a calculator, but
when you're trying to get a bunch of different colours,
it becomes a bit of a pain to deal with. Hence this simple
tool. Select the colour you want, and it automatically
calculates the corresponding rgb565 value, ready for
direct pasting into your code!

This tool is *quite* basic at the moment, and does not
let you input colours in terms of normal hex - something
that I was really hoping to achieve, but for once, python
failed for me and I could not get it to work D:

Anyway, to run this, you'll need to have Python (obviously)
as well as wxPython (http://www.wxpython.org/). I built
this against Python 2.7 and wxPython 2.9.2.3. It might
work with other versions, but I don't know.

If you want to edit it at all, PLEASE DO. If you manage
to make it better, I would love to hear about it!

Thanks for looking!
